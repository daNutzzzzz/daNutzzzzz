I'm just getting started out in the development world but I think it's a pretty good start. I started learning python in Febuary of 2020 and since being in quarantine I've built some great projects using Vue, Flask (python), and FastAPI (python).

There's currently not an "App Store" for servers. I don't want to deal with the overhead or responsibility of making one so I'll leave that up to the people but I feel like with a standard format (for now it's json or yaml but I'll be incorporating docker-compose soon) I can enable people to easily create their own and provide a good vehicle/interface to manage them. This is that vehicle.

This is a Template (or a distributed app store depending on how you look at it) which was initially built for portainer but after seeing the potential something that actually supported a good templating format has to change how people use servers I've built it out for multiple platforms (most importantly Yacht) although I haven't had time to keep up with the requests from people.
